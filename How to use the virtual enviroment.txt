Since its recommended due to a lot of installs from a requirement.txt file, its better to develop this project
in a virtual enviroment. The way to do it is super easy.

Here is a link for the visual info on how to do this:

Instructions:
1. Install python(preferabbly the most recent version)
2. Install git bash(this is my preferred method of using linux based commands on windows but you can use CMD for instance)
3. Install the virtual enviroment: pip install virtualenv
3.5. Once installed, cd into the file directory(budget-buddy in this case). The command is: virtualenv venv
4. Once installed, the project repo should have a virtual enviroment made, start the virtual enviroment based on these commands:
    source venv/bin/activate       # Linux and Mac bash shell
    source venv/Scripts/activate   # Windows bash shell
    .\venv\Scripts\activate        # Windows CMD or powershell

5. Once inside of a NEW virtual enviroment. You must run this command: pip install -r requirements.txt
    - This command will install all libraries that are used in the project such as Django and bootstrap
6. I am not sure if VS code will be installed automatically, but it should be.
7.5. In your commandline, you can use code . to open VSCode and will open the repo of the project
8. If you instead wish to use command line, these are the commands you need to use
    python manage.py collectstatic  #collects static files, run this if you are hitting errors or when first opening the project
    python manage.py makemigrations
    python manage.py migrate        #shouldnt need to be use unless you create a new model, but its incase you hit errors just run these 2 migration commands
    python manage.py runserver      #This runs the server, should take you to the login page that is setup. 
        - If you need, the link to the local server when running is: 127.0.0.1:8000/
